# fonts-rpm-macros

The fonts-rpm-macros project is an effort to streamline font packaging, helping font packagers to produce clean, consistent and sane packages.

It contains:

- spec templates and rpm macros
- fontconfig templates and documentation

â€¦ and any other material we feel can help font packagers in their work. New templates are added whenever a new packaging pattern is identified.

## History

The fonts-rpm-macros project was initiated by the [Fedora Fonts Special Interest Group](http://fonts.fedoraproject.org/), and is the reference for Fedora font packaging guidelines. It is therefore a bit rpm-oriented. However great care was extended to keep it distribution-neutral, and contributors from other distributions are welcome, even if they use different packaging systems, and want to add non-rpm templates.
