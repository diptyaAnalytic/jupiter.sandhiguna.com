ABOUT libLASi
=============

The libLASi website is located at http://www.unifont.org/lasi/ with the project
page located at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lasi.

libLASi is a library that provides a C++ stream output interface (with
operator<< ) to writing Postscript and Encapsulated Postscript documents 
containing any of the world's scripts supported by Unicode 4.0 and the Pango
complex text layout engine.  You can use any TrueType or OpenType fonts that
you want. The library accomodates both left-to-right (e.g. most European 
languages) as well as right-to-left (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic) scripts, as well
as Complex Text Layout (CTL) scripts such as Devanagari, Bengali, Thai, and
other Indic and Indic-derived scripts. You can include any number of
different scripts or languages in the same document without need for any
special configuration or layout calculation on the programmer's part.
libLASi accepts Unicode strings encoded in the UTF-8 transformation format
which is the de facto standard on Linux and other *nix systems.

Although Postscript printing capability exists in open-source toolkits such
as Gnome and QT, libLASi was designed for projects that are independent of
any one Graphic User Interface (GUI) toolkit or do not even make use of a
GUI interface but still require the ability to produce Postscript output
containing Unicode text.

For installation instructions, see http://www.unifont.org/lasi/

For example programs that uses libLASi, please see the examples
directory located in the install tree at
$prefix/share/lasi$version/examples where $prefix is the installation
prefix and $version is the version of lasi (1.1.3 at the time of
writing). An example is provided which tests that libLASi is robust
against some common font issues such as a missing glyph or pango
deciding to use a pure bitmapped font such as the popular Noto Color
Emoji that does not provide the outline font data that libLASi needs).
Simple and slightly more extensive examples are provided as well that
have more interesting output.  For more details concerning the examples,
please consult examples/README.
