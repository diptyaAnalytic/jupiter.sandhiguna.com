=head1 NAME

Mail::AuthenticationResults - Object Oriented Authentication-Results Headers

=head1 VERSION

version 2.20210112

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object Oriented Authentication-Results email headers.

This parser copes with most styles of Authentication-Results header seen in the wild, but is not yet fully RFC7601 compliant

Differences from RFC7601

key/value pairs are parsed when present in the authserv-id section, this is against RFC but has been seen in headers added by Yahoo!.

Comments added between key/value pairs will be added after them in the data structures and when stringified.

It is a work in progress..
